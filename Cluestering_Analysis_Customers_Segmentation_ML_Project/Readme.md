# WELCOME

Welcome to ***Clustering (Customer Segmentation) Project***.

At the end of this project, we perform ***Cluster Analysis*** with an ***Unsupervised Learning*** method.

---

In this project, customers are required to be segmented according to the purchasing history obtained from the membership cards of a big mall.

After getting to know the data set quickly, we perform *Exploratory Data Analysis*. We observe the distribution of customers according to different variables, also discover relationships and correlations between variables. Then we spesify the different variables to use for cluster analysis.

Finally, we cluster customers using the *K-Means Clustering* method, after that we label the clusters
